# HTML Coding Style Convention

> &nbsp;&nbsp;We follow W3 School HTML style guide and coding conventions: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp <br> Additional coding style will be specified in coming days.


### Apart from the above, we personally follow below rules for HTML codes. 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;General <b>class variable naming convention</b> for this project is to use lowercase with no whitespace. <br> Instead, whitespaces are replaced to '_' <b>(good ex.: this_is_class_variable)</b> rather than concatenating two words togther distinguishing them with a uppercase letter on every syllable(bad ex.: thisIsClassVariable).

> &nbsp;&nbsp;General <b>id variable naming convention</b> for this project is to use lowercase letter as a start but preceed with the uppercase letter on the next following word <b>(ex: thisIsID)</b>.

# CSS Coding Style Convention

# webOS contest interviewers' preferred style
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Try not to misuse the term **"webOS"** 'w' must start with lowercase letter and following 'O' must be in uppercase letter.<br>
> *Bad example: webos, Webos, WebOS, WEBOS, etc.<br><br>*
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Exception: on the code, particulary on assigning a variable or a class names, the code style takes a superior priority more than any other literal rules. Therefore, such exception like WebOSConnect.java can be possible (Java class name starts with the uppercase letter, and every syllable is seperated by starting with a uppercase letter as well).<br><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;However, consider replacing the location of the term "webOS" to different location to pair nicely with other words which satisfies both the code style and the perferred style.<br>
> *Example: WebOSConnect.java -> connectWebOS.java, var connect_web_os; -> var connect_webOS;*
