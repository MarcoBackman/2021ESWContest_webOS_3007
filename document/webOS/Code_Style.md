# HTML Coding Style Convention

> &nbsp;&nbsp;We follow W3 School HTML style guide and coding conventions: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp <br> Additional coding style will be specified in coming days.


### Apart from the above, we personally follow below rules for HTML codes. 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;General <b>class variable naming convention</b> for this project is to use lowercase with no whitespace. <br> Instead, whitespaces are replaced to '_' <b>(good ex.: this_is_class_variable)</b> rather than concatenating two words togther distinguishing them with a uppercase letter on every syllable(bad ex.: thisIsClassVariable).

> &nbsp;&nbsp;General <b>id variable naming convention</b> for this project is to use lowercase letter as a start but preceed with the uppercase letter on the next following word <b>(ex: thisIsID)</b>.
