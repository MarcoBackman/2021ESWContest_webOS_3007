## Who are we, and what are we aiming for?

**Who are we?**
> &nbsp;&nbsp;**'@bammPark - Team Leader'** is a team leader. He will be working on Yolo medel plan design, applying LG ThinQ AI service(Audio filtering and Facial detection) to the project. <br><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;**'@MarcoBackman - SWdev • Collaborator'** is a SW developer. He will be handling a webOS application that requires html, css, js and database management system language skills.  <br><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;**'@JuneKoo Kang - engineerjkk • Collaborator'** is a embedded developer. He will be handling ESP8266 hardware devices to recieve and send raw data over the network, and will handle PCB design and overall product ordering.   <br><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;**'@submarine214 - supporter • Collaborator'** is a documenter/editor/tester. He will support us on overall workloads; especially focusing on documentation and testing. <br><br>


**What is the ultimate goal of this project?**
> &nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of our development is to create a diverse and integrated system which involves overarching trends in Internet of Things(IoT). This project distinguishes from other features in associative automotive function with flexible finance distribution in shared living environment.


## About our project<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is conprised of two major sections: Hardware and Software.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the software section, we build an application program that suits well under webOS system architecture, regardless of its low level knowledge (e.g. kernal level, shell development).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our development will only pursuit on logic architecture of the webpage, which is a webOS app, and visualization of the database that stores data from hardware system.<br>

### Encodings.
> We strickly regulate our code encoding to be in UTF-8 format. Use of any encoding format other then UTF-8 will be prohibited.

## To Do list
&nbsp;&nbsp; **'@MarcoBackman'** is currently working on webOS applications. Estimated overall job end-date is July 30th, but html,css part will be presumably finished before July 15th. - See: [webOS webpage progress](https://github.com/MarcoBackman/2021ESWContest_webOS_3007/projects/1)
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; **'@bammPark'** and **'@JuneKoo Kang'** are currently preparing on thinQ AI processing. - See: [HW 부문 계획](https://github.com/MarcoBackman/2021ESWContest_webOS_3007/projects/2)
